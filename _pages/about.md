**History and purpose**
The Thames Valley Fungus Group was set up in 2002. Our members have a range of mycological abilities and interests and beginners are welcome.  We visit a variety of sites to identify and record fungi. This may involve removal of specimens from site for further examination, but only where necessary and with appropriate permissions from the landowner. We do not collect for culinary purposes.  Most of our forays take place in the autumn, but we generally also hold one or two earlier in the year.

**Membership**
We welcome new members of all abilities and suggest you come along to one of our forays to try us out! If you would like to become a member we will add you to the membership group email and change a small notional membership fee to cover the group costs (currenlty Â£2 per person as of 2024) that is collected during the foray season.
